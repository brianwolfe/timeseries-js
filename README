A javascript library for dealing with timeseries data, in particular for preparing
it for plotting.

Defines helpers for plotting timeseries, in particular for moderately large datasets
of several million points. It includes basic utilities to automatically subsample
the timeseries data based on the number of points in a given window. It typically
deals with typed arrays internally to allow javascript engines to optimize
execution.
